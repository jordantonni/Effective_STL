Sequence Containers:
--- ONLY THESE ARE ARRAY BASED -----
    - Array:
        - Contiguous (Good for cache hits)
        - Not dynamic resize (Stored on stack)
        - array<int,4> is different type from array<int,3>

    - Vector:
        - Contiguous (Good for cache hits)
        - Dynamic resizing (Stored on heap)
        - Insert/Remove at End O(1)
        - Insert/Remove at Beginning or Middle O(n)
        - Search O(n)

    - Deque:
        - Not Contiguous (List of arrays) (Bad for cache hits)
        - Insert/Remove at Start/End faster than Vector
        - Insert/Remove at Middle O(n)
        - Search O(n)


--- EVERYTHING BELOW IS NODE BASED------


    - List:
        - Not contiguous (Bad for cache hits)
        - Double linked
        - Insert/Remove anywhere O(1)
        - Search O(n)
        - No random access
        - Splice O(1)

    - Forward List:
        - Only forward link
        - Not contiguous (Bad for cache hits)

Associative (Sorted) Containers (Binary tree)
    - Set:
        - Sorted on the value of the item itself
        - No duplicates
        - Insert/Remove O(log n)
            - Can reduce to O(1) by providing an iterator that "hints" where the value should go
        - Search O(log n)

    - Multiset:
        - Allows duplicated items
        - Search O(n)

    - Map:
        - Sorted on the key in the key/value pair
        - No duplictes
        - Same stats as set

    - Multimap:
        - Allows duplicates

Unordered Containers (Hash Table)
    - Hash table is an array (of buckets) to linked lists (Hashing with chaining)
    - Search O(1) Fastest search of all
        - i.e. Unordered Map O(1), map O(log n)

    - Unordered Set:
        -
    - Unordered Multiset:
        - Allows duplicates
    - Unordered Map:
        -
    - Unordered Multimap:
        - Allows duplicates


Container Adapters (Modify underlying container)
    - Restricted interface to meet special needs
    - Use fundamental containers

    1) Stack
        - LIFO, push, pop, top

    2) Queue
        - FIFO, push, pop, front, back

    3) Priority Queue (First item has greatest priority)
        - push, pop, top
