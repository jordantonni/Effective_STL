/*
 * Always #include the proper headers
 * 
 * Most implementations have headers that include others:
 *  i.e. <vector> #includes <string>
 *  
 *  If you are using something from a header, #include that specific header always!
 *
 *
 * Summary:
 *  - Always #include a header for what you use, even if another header #includes it for you
